## CS 1.6 maps collection developed by Unimator
Most of the maps (if not all) are using `haldlife.wad`, which was a common practice these days. You should add this file in your Hammer for proper rendering.

I don't do mapping anymore and I don't remember much about it. But if you find any problems like missing files etc. feel free to text me on Steam (https://steamcommunity.com/id/unimator). I'll do my best to help you.
